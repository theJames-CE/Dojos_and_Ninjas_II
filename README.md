<h2>Now, the Assignment:</h2><br>

<b><i>Pro Tip:</b></i> Be sure to test each individual feature before you move on to the next one. It may help to write down which feature you are working on and record any bugs you come across and how you solved it for later reference.

<h2>Sensei Bonus: Update and Delete (Optional, but highly encouraged!)</h2><br>

Let's add update and delete functionality to the Ninjas! In building these features you will also practice making anchor tags in your templates that use path variables, such as "dojos/1", as well as redirecting your server to other routes that take path variable values, like a dojo id.<br>
